# Final-Year-Project
Welcome to my small final year project, my project topic is **Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)**.

According to Jack Kelly's paper, NILM estimates appliance-by-appliance electricity consumption from a single meter that measures the whole home's electricity demand.

## Latest update: 

Upload experiment.ipynb, which seperates the experiment with the algorithm

## Next step: 

1. Write comments and plot the figures.

2. Learn traditional machine learning method such as Supported Vector Machine.

3. Prepare the formal experiments and record the data.
